  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This recipe will teach you how to make an authentic Margherita Pizza.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
    <li>1 cup of water</li>
    <li>1 package of active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of flour for dusting</li>
    <li>2 cups of pizza sauce</li>
    <li>20 slices of fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>20 leaves of fresh basil</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>sea salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl & set aside</li>
    <li>Mix water, yeast and sugar in a large bow. Let it stand until the yeast begins to form a creamy foam, this should take about 5 minutes</li>
    <li>Stir half of the flour mixture into the yeast mixture until there are no dry spots remaining. Stir the remaining flour in 1/2 cup at a time, mix well after each addition. When the dough pulls together, turn it out of the bowl into a floured surface and knead until it's smooth and elastic</li>
    <li> Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat the dough with oil. Cover it with light cloth and let the dough rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F) until the dough is doubled in volume. Punch the dough down and divide it to four balls of equal size</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F</li>
    <li> Stretch out 1 dough ball to form a circle that is 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place the dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. Top it with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle the pizza with a tablespoon of olive oil and finish with sea salt to taste</li>
    <li> Slide the pizza onto the pizza stone and bake until cheese is bubbly and crust is golden brown, roughly 5 to 7 minutes</li>
  </ol>
